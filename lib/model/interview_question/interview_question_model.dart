All modern database management systems like SQL, MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, ORACLE, My-SQL and Microsoft Access are based on RDBMS.\r\nA relational database refers to a database that stores data in a structured format, using rows and columns. \r\nThis makes it easy to locate and access specific values within the database.\r\nIt is relational because the values within each table are related to each other.\r\nTables may also be related to other tables.","LikeCount":3,"DisLikeCount":2,"clapCount":41},{"QueID":3,"Que":"What is SQL?","Ans":"SQL stands for Structured Query language, pronounced as \"S-Q-L\" or sometimes as \"See-Quel\".\r\nSQL is the standard language for dealing with Relational Databases.

Behavior: Primary Key is used to identify a row (record) in a table, whereas Unique-key is to prevent duplicate values in a column (with the exception of a null entry).\r\n2. Indexing: By default SQL-engine creates Clustered Index on primary-key if not exists and Non-Clustered Index on Unique-key.\r\n3. Nullability: Primary key does not include Null values, whereas Unique-key can.\r\n4. Existence: A table can have at most one primary key, but can have multiple Unique-key.\r\n5.
